# Cat-Mouse

A simple path-finding exercise project!  

Build your maze by placing walls within the grid 
(you can save some time by pressing the random maze generation button at the top toolbar).

Place the cat, the mouse and any amount of milk boxes you want within the grid. 

Press Play. 

The cat will get all the milk boxes and the mouse, 
following the path that requires the least amount of moves.

The cat will aim to catch the mouse last. The only way for the mouse
not die last, is if the mouse is in the way of the cat's milk path.
