# Cat-Mouse

A simple path-finding exercise project!  

Place a cat anywhere on the grid, place a mouse 
and any amount of milk boxes around. 

Build as many walls as you want, then press Play.

The cat will get all the milk boxes and the mouse, 
following the path that requires the least amount of moves.

The cat will aim to catch the mouse last. The only way for the mouse
not die last, is if the mouse is in the way of the cat's milk path.
